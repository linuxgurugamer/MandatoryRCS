	description = Rumours says that STEADLER recently had a malfunction with their drills, resulting in holes misplacement in RV-105 casings. And suddenly, here is a whole line of RV-105 variants with custom nozzle configurations. This one has two front nozzles and is recommended to be mounted in symmetric pairs, but can also be useful in four-way symmetry for the extra thrust power this give.
